## Welcome!

My name is Eileen Shea and I am a Biostatistician Data Analyst with Mental Health Data Science - a division of the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI), and Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene (RFMH). My interests lie at the intersections of environmental health science, mental health throught the lifecourse, biostatistics, and economics.
