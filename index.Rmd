### I have a webpage!

And I can put all kinds of stuff on it!

I can add additional text.

I *could* write some code but I'm not going to. 


### Add some links

I like [to look for code on the internet](https://www.google.com).

I can link directly to my [about page](about.html).


### Picture of a dog

She's a beaut:
